# Projection Head Training in Stage A

## Overview

This document explains the **projection training enhancement** added to Stage A of the Level 1 multi-modal heterogeneous GNN training.

### Problem Addressed

**Original Issue**: In the initial implementation, projection heads (`mrna_projection` and `cnv_projection`) were **not trained during Stage A**. They remained randomly initialized until Stage B, when they received gradients from consistency and entropy losses.

**Consequences**:
1. ❌ Projections start Stage B with random weights after 100 epochs of Stage A
2. ❌ Stage B must simultaneously learn projections AND attention from scratch
3. ❌ Potential training instability and slower convergence
4. ❌ Disconnect between reconstruction pathway (decoders) and fusion pathway (projections)

---

## Solution: Projection Training Loss

We introduce **two new loss components** specifically for Stage A that train projection heads to extract meaningful modality-specific representations.

### 1. Projection Reconstruction Loss (`L_projection`)

**Purpose**: Ensure pooled modality embeddings (after projection) preserve enough information to predict patient-level feature statistics.

**Mechanism**:
```
gene_emb → mrna_projection → pool → z_mrna → decoder → mean_mRNA_per_patient
                                                       ↓
                                              L_proj = MSE(pred, actual)
```

**Implementation**: [`src/losses/projection_loss.py:ProjectionReconstructionLoss`](../src/losses/projection_loss.py)

**Details**:
- Creates small decoders that predict **patient-level mean values** from pooled embeddings
- For mRNA: `z_mrna [batch, 256] → MLP → predicted_mean_mrna [batch]`
- For CNV: `z_cnv [batch, 256] → MLP → predicted_mean_cnv [batch]`
- Compares predictions with actual mean values: `MSE(predicted, actual_mean)`

**Why this works**:
- Forces projections to preserve modality-specific information
- Bridges the gap between node-level (reconstruction) and patient-level (fusion) representations
- Ensures projections extract features relevant for downstream tasks

### 2. Projection Diversity Regularization (`L_proj_reg`)

**Purpose**: Encourage `mrna_projection` and `cnv_projection` to extract **different features** from gene embeddings.

**Mechanism**:
```
L_diversity = |cos_similarity(z_mrna, z_cnv)|

Minimize this → z_mrna and z_cnv become more different
```

**Implementation**: [`src/losses/projection_loss.py:ProjectionRegularizationLoss`](../src/losses/projection_loss.py)

**Details**:
- Computes cosine similarity between mRNA and CNV pooled embeddings
- Penalizes high similarity (encourages diversity)
- Prevents both projections from learning the same transformation

**Why this works**:
- Without this, both projections might collapse to the same transformation
- Encourages specialization: `W_mrna` learns mRNA-specific features, `W_cnv` learns CNV-specific features
- Improves attention mechanism effectiveness in Stage B

## Updated Loss Functions

### Stage A Total Loss (NEW)

```
L_StageA = L_recon_mrna + L_recon_cnv + L_recon_cpg + L_recon_mirna
         + λ_edge · L_edge
         + λ_projection · L_projection          ← NEW
         + λ_proj_reg · L_proj_reg              ← NEW
```

**Default weights**:
- `λ_projection = 0.1` (configurable in `config/default.yaml`)
- `λ_proj_reg = 0.01`

### Stage B Total Loss (Unchanged)

```
L_StageB = L_StageA (without projection losses)
         + λ_cons · L_consistency
         + λ_ent · L_entropy
```

   - `ProjectionReconstructionLoss`: Main projection training loss
   - `ProjectionAlignmentLoss`: Alternative alignment-based approach (not used by default)
   - `ProjectionRegularizationLoss`: Diversity regularization

2. **`src/models/multimodal_gnn.py`** (MODIFIED)
   - Added projection loss modules in `__init__`
   - Added projection loss computation in Stage A forward pass
   - Updated total loss calculation

3. **`config/default.yaml`** (MODIFIED)
   - Added `lambda_projection: 0.1`
   - Added `lambda_proj_reg: 0.01`

### Code Changes

#### In `MultiModalGNNWithDecoders.__init__`:
```python
# NEW: Projection training loss (Stage A)
self.projection_loss = ProjectionReconstructionLoss(config, decoder_type="simple")

# NEW: Projection regularization (Stage A)
self.projection_reg = ProjectionRegularizationLoss(
    reg_type="diversity",
    weight=config["losses"].get("lambda_proj_reg", 0.01)
)
```

#### In `MultiModalGNNWithDecoders.forward`:
```python
# Stage A specific losses: Projection training
if self.model.training_stage == "A":
    # Projection reconstruction loss
    proj_loss, proj_detail = self.projection_loss(
        output["modality_embeddings"],
        original
    )
    losses["projection"] = proj_loss * self.config["losses"].get("lambda_projection", 0.1)
    losses["projection_detail"] = proj_detail

    # Projection regularization (diversity)
    proj_reg = self.projection_reg(output["modality_embeddings"])
    losses["projection_reg"] = proj_reg
```

## Gradient Flow Analysis

### Before (Original Implementation)

```
Stage A:
  L_recon → decoders → gene_emb → encoder
  L_edge → node_emb → encoder

  Projections: ❌ NO GRADIENTS

Stage B:
  L_consistency → h_fused → z_mrna/z_cnv → projections ✓
  L_entropy → attention → z_mrna/z_cnv → projections ✓
```

### After (With Projection Training)

```
Stage A:
  L_recon → decoders → gene_emb → encoder
  L_edge → node_emb → encoder
  L_projection → z_mrna/z_cnv → projections ✓✓✓ NEW!
  L_proj_reg → z_mrna/z_cnv → projections ✓✓✓ NEW!

Stage B:
  L_consistency → h_fused → z_mrna/z_cnv → projections ✓
  L_entropy → attention → z_mrna/z_cnv → projections ✓
```

**Result**: Projections now receive gradients in BOTH stages!

---

## Expected Benefits

### 1. **Better Initialization for Stage B**
- Projections start Stage B with **meaningful weights** instead of random
- `W_mrna` already knows how to extract mRNA-relevant features
- `W_cnv` already knows how to extract CNV-relevant features

### 2. **Faster Stage B Convergence**
- Less to learn in Stage B (attention only, not projections)
- More stable training
- Potentially fewer epochs needed

### 3. **Improved Final Performance**
- Better separation between mRNA and CNV modalities
- More effective attention mechanism
- Higher quality patient embeddings

### 4. **Consistency Across Stages**
- Projections serve a purpose in both Stage A (reconstruction) and Stage B (fusion)
- Smooth transition between stages

---

## Configuration

### Tuning Projection Loss Weights

**`lambda_projection`** (default: 0.1):
- Controls how much projection training affects Stage A
- **Increase** (e.g., 0.2-0.5) if projections are not learning enough
- **Decrease** (e.g., 0.05) if reconstruction quality degrades
- Set to 0 to disable (revert to original behavior)

**`lambda_proj_reg`** (default: 0.01):
- Controls diversity regularization strength
- **Increase** (e.g., 0.05) if mRNA and CNV embeddings are too similar
- **Decrease** (e.g., 0.001) if embeddings become too different
- Set to 0 to disable diversity regularization

### Example Configurations

**Conservative (minimal impact)**:
```yaml
losses:
  lambda_projection: 0.05
  lambda_proj_reg: 0.001
```

**Aggressive (strong projection training)**:
```yaml
losses:
  lambda_projection: 0.5
  lambda_proj_reg: 0.05
```

**Default (balanced)**:
```yaml
losses:
  lambda_projection: 0.1
  lambda_proj_reg: 0.01
```

## Monitoring Training

### Metrics to Watch

During Stage A training, monitor these new metrics:

1. **`projection` loss**: Should decrease over epochs
   - Target: <0.05 by end of Stage A
   - If stuck high (>0.1): Increase `lambda_projection`

2. **`projection_detail['mrna']`**: mRNA projection loss
   - Should be similar to main reconstruction loss

3. **`projection_detail['cnv']`**: CNV projection loss
   - Should be similar to main reconstruction loss

4. **`projection_reg`**: Diversity regularization
   - Positive value, should stabilize (not necessarily decrease)
   - Very low (<0.001): Projections are very diverse (good!)
   - High (>0.5): Projections might be too similar

### TensorBoard Logs

New logs added:
- `Loss/projection_A`: Projection reconstruction loss (Stage A only)
- `Loss/projection_reg_A`: Projection diversity loss (Stage A only)

---

## Validation

### How to Verify It's Working

**After Stage A completes**, check that projections are trained:

```python
# Load Stage A checkpoint
checkpoint = torch.load('outputs/checkpoints/fold_0/checkpoint_stageA_epoch100.pt')

# Check projection weights are NOT near initialization
W_mrna = model.model.modality_pooling.mrna_projection.weight
W_cnv = model.model.modality_pooling.cnv_projection.weight

# These should be different from each other
similarity = F.cosine_similarity(W_mrna.flatten(), W_cnv.flatten(), dim=0)
print(f"Projection similarity: {similarity.item():.3f}")
# Good: <0.3 (very different)
# Concerning: >0.8 (too similar, might need more diversity reg)

# Check projection embeddings are meaningful
z_mrna = model(data)['modality_embeddings']['mrna']
z_cnv = model(data)['modality_embeddings']['cnv']
emb_similarity = F.cosine_similarity(z_mrna, z_cnv, dim=-1).mean()
print(f"Embedding similarity: {emb_similarity.item():.3f}")
# Good: 0.3-0.7 (somewhat related but distinct)
# Concerning: >0.9 (too similar) or <0.1 (completely unrelated)
```

## Comparison: With vs. Without Projection Training

| Aspect | Without (Original) | With (Enhanced) |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Stage A** | Projections idle | Projections actively trained |
| **After Stage A** | Projections random | Projections meaningful |
| **Stage B start** | Cold start (random) | Warm start (pretrained) |
| **Stage B epochs** | ~100 needed | Potentially 50-75 sufficient |
| **Total training time** | Baseline | +5-10% (small overhead) |
| **Final performance** | Baseline | Expected +2-5% improvement |

---

## Backward Compatibility

### Disabling Projection Training

To revert to original behavior (for comparison):

```yaml
losses:
  lambda_projection: 0.0  # Disable projection training
  lambda_proj_reg: 0.0    # Disable diversity regularization
```

This will:
- Skip projection loss computation in Stage A
- Projections remain untrained until Stage B
- Reproduce original implementation behavior

---

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to consider:

1. **Adaptive weighting**: Automatically adjust `lambda_projection` based on reconstruction quality
2. **Node-level projection loss**: Use alignment loss at node level (more expensive but potentially better)
3. **Cross-modality reconstruction**: Train projections to reconstruct OTHER modalities (contrastive learning)
4. **Curriculum learning**: Start with low `lambda_projection`, gradually increase
